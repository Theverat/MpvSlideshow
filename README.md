# MpvSlideshow

Opens all photos and videos in a directory and shows them as a slideshow with a simple black crossfade.<br>
Uses [mpv](https://mpv.io/) as backend.<br>
This project was started with the 
[libmpv qt_opengl example](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-examples/tree/master/libmpv/qt_opengl) 
as base.

## How to compile

* Install Qt (at least 5.6) and QtCreator
* Install mpv with [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build#building-libmpv)
* Open project in QtCreator and compile

I successfully compiled on Linux and Windows.
